# Sudoku App

This is a single page web application which allows users to play sudoku. Who doesn't enjoy solving a sudoku every so often...

It is somewhat of a work in progress. I plan to add extra functionality and features as time allows.

## Tech stack

This app is written in JS.

Some of the key modules used in this project are:
1. React and Redux - for the front-end
1. Material UI - for components used on the front-end
1. Express (Node.js) - for the server
1. sudoku-gen - for the sudoku puzzle generation
